  APIKeyAuth:
    type: apiKey
    in: header
    name: X-Auth-Token
    description: >
      A valid API key is required to access this API.  API keys can be allocated
      via the IBM Cloud interface, and are associated with an instance of the
      Event Streams service. API key values must be supplied on every REST request
      using the `X-Auth-Token` HTTP header. Failure to specify a valid API key
      will result in the REST request failing with a 401 (Unauthorized) status
      code. `X-Auth-Token` header is deprecated, `Authorization` header is recommanded.
  TokenAuth:
    type: apiKey
    in: header
    name: Authorization
    description: >
      A valid token or API key is required to access this API. API keys can be allocated
      via the IBM Cloud interface, and are associated with an instance of the
      Event Streams service. Token is obtained upon login to IBM Cloud and is associated with 
      the identity of the user. Either token or API key must be supplied on every REST request
      using the `Authorization` `Bearer ${TokenOrAPIKey}` HTTP header. Failure to do so will 
      result in the REST request failing with a 401 (Unauthorized) status code.
  BasicAuth:
    type: basic
    description: >
      To use basic authentication, the HTTP header name is `Authorization`, value is 
      `Basic <base64 encoded value of username:password>.
      For both enterprise and standard plan, user name is `token`, password is API key.
